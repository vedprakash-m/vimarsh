- ❌ Testing client configurations

**Configuration Management:**
- ❌ Multiple client configurations (dev, prod, testing)
- ❌ Helper functions for client creation
- ❌ Model information reporting
- ❌ Connection testing
- ❌ Health check methods

**Advanced Prompt Engineering:**
- ❌ Context-specific prompt templates
- ❌ Language-specific prompt handling
- ❌ Advanced prompt building with retrieved chunks
- ❌ System prompt customization by safety level

### 🔄 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Needs Enhancement)

**Content Validation:**
- 🔄 Basic harmful content detection → Need advanced pattern matching
- 🔄 Simple citation check → Need comprehensive citation validation
- 🔄 Basic length validation → Need detailed response analysis

**Error Handling:**
- 🔄 Basic try/catch → Need comprehensive error classification
- 🔄 Simple fallback → Need intelligent fallback selection
- 🔄 Basic logging → Need detailed operation logging

**Response Structure:**
- 🔄 Basic metadata → Need comprehensive response metadata
- 🔄 Simple confidence → Need multi-factor confidence scoring
- 🔄 Basic warnings → Need detailed warning categorization

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Safety Features (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Advanced Safety Ratings** - Extract and analyze Gemini safety ratings
2. **Content Blocking Detection** - Detect when content is blocked by safety
3. **Comprehensive Validation** - Implement all validation patterns from old system
4. **Mock Compatibility** - Ensure all methods work with test mocks

### Phase 2: Token & Cost Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Real Usage Tracking** - Extract actual token usage from Gemini metadata
2. **Cost Integration** - Connect with cost management system
3. **User/Session Tracking** - Implement user and session-based tracking
4. **Usage Analytics** - Provide detailed usage analytics

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (LOW PRIORITY)
1. **Multiple Response Formats** - Support all legacy response types
2. **Advanced Citation System** - Implement comprehensive citation extraction
3. **Configuration Management** - Add helper functions and configurations
4. **Connection Testing** - Implement health checks and connection tests

### Phase 4: Testing & Compatibility (ONGOING)
1. **Test Suite Enhancement** - Ensure all tests pass with new system
2. **Mock Integration** - Perfect mock compatibility
3. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize for production use
4. **Documentation** - Complete API documentation

## Recommendation

Given the complexity of implementing all missing features, I recommend:

1. **Implement Phase 1 (Critical Safety)** - Essential for production safety
2. **Keep old system as reference** - Until new system is fully equivalent
3. **Gradual migration** - Test each phase before proceeding
4. **Safety-first approach** - Never compromise on safety features

The new system has a solid foundation but needs Phase 1 features before it can replace the old system safely.
