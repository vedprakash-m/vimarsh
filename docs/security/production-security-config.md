# Production Security Configuration

## Security Framework

This document outlines the comprehensive security configuration for Vimarsh production environment.

## Infrastructure Security

### Azure Key Vault
- **Encryption**: All secrets stored with Azure-managed encryption
- **Access Control**: RBAC-based access with least privilege principle
- **Soft Delete**: 7-day retention with option for recovery
- **Purge Protection**: Disabled for cost optimization (can be enabled for critical production)
- **Network Access**: Public access with firewall rules (can be restricted to VNets)

### Cosmos DB Security
- **Encryption**: 
  - At rest: Microsoft-managed keys
  - In transit: TLS 1.2+ for all connections
- **Authentication**: Connection strings stored in Key Vault
- **Backup**: Continuous 7-day backup for disaster recovery
- **Network**: Private endpoints available for enhanced security
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for granular permissions

### Azure Functions Security
- **Authentication**: 
  - Microsoft Entra External ID integration
  - JWT token validation with proper audience and issuer verification
  - Function-level authorization
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic forced through HTTPS
- **TLS Version**: Minimum TLS 1.2 required
- **CORS**: Configured for specific frontend origins
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in Key Vault references
- **Managed Identity**: System-assigned identity for Key Vault access

### Storage Account Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic requires HTTPS
- **TLS Version**: Minimum TLS 1.2
- **Public Access**: Blob public access disabled
- **Encryption**: Microsoft-managed keys for services encryption
- **Network**: Firewall rules configurable for IP restrictions

### Static Web App Security
- **Headers**: Security headers configured
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- **HTTPS**: Automatic HTTPS redirection
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Azure Functions for API calls

## Application Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Provider**: Microsoft Entra External ID
- **Token Type**: JWT with RS256 signing
- **Token Validation**: 
  - Signature verification using JWKS
  - Audience validation
  - Issuer validation
  - Expiration validation
- **Scopes**: User.Read, openid, profile, email
- **Session Management**: Stateless JWT-based authentication

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented at application level
- **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated
- **SQL Injection**: Protected through parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Output encoding and CSP headers
- **CSRF Protection**: JWT tokens prevent CSRF attacks

### Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Encryption at Rest**: Azure-managed encryption for all data stores
- **Data Classification**: Spiritual content classified and handled appropriately
- **Personal Data**: Minimal collection, GDPR-compliant handling
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all access and modifications

## Monitoring & Compliance

### Security Monitoring
- **Application Insights**: Security event monitoring
- **Failed Authentication**: Tracking and alerting
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual access patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: DDoS and load monitoring

### Compliance Features
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, consent management, right to deletion
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Backup**: Regular automated backups with encryption

## Security Configurations by Environment

### Development
- Relaxed CORS for localhost development
- Debug logging enabled
- Free tier resources with basic security
- Test authentication with development tenants

### Staging
- Production-like security with staging-specific configurations
- Enhanced logging for testing
- Staging authentication tenant
- Network restrictions similar to production

### Production
- Maximum security configuration
- Restricted CORS to production domains
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Production authentication tenant
- Network security groups and firewall rules
- Advanced threat protection enabled

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Secret Management
1. **No Secrets in Code**: All secrets stored in Azure Key Vault
2. **Rotation Strategy**: Secrets rotation process documented
3. **Access Control**: Minimal access principle for secret access
4. **Audit Trail**: All secret access logged and monitored

### Network Security
1. **TLS Everywhere**: All communications encrypted
2. **Certificate Management**: Automatic SSL certificate management
3. **Domain Validation**: Proper DNS validation for domains
4. **IP Whitelisting**: Available for enhanced security

### Application Security
1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated
2. **Output Encoding**: All outputs properly encoded
3. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
4. **Session Security**: Secure session management with JWT

### Monitoring & Response
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Security events monitored in real-time
2. **Incident Response**: Documented incident response procedures
3. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups with tested recovery procedures
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region backup and recovery plan
