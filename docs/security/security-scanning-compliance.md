# Vimarsh Security Scanning and Compliance Verification

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive security scanning and compliance verification infrastructure for the Vimarsh AI Agent platform. The security framework ensures that all deployments meet industry standards for security, privacy, and spiritual content handling.

## Components

### 1. Security Scanner (`scripts/security-scanner.sh`)

A comprehensive bash script that performs automated security scanning across multiple categories.

#### Features:
- **Dependency Scanning**: Identifies vulnerable dependencies in Python and Node.js packages
- **Secret Detection**: Scans for exposed API keys, passwords, and sensitive credentials
- **Code Security Analysis**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities in source code
- **Infrastructure Security**: Validates Azure configuration and security settings
- **Compliance Verification**: Checks adherence to GDPR, SOC2, and spiritual content standards

#### Usage:
```bash
# Full security scan
./scripts/security-scanner.sh --environment prod --scan-type full --verbose

# Quick security scan
./scripts/security-scanner.sh --environment staging --scan-type quick

# Compliance-focused scan
./scripts/security-scanner.sh --environment prod --scan-type compliance --output html

# Custom category scan
./scripts/security-scanner.sh --category secrets --environment dev
```

#### Scan Types:
- **quick**: Fast scan of critical vulnerabilities (secrets + dependencies)
- **full**: Comprehensive security scan across all categories (default)
- **compliance**: Focus on regulatory compliance verification
- **custom**: Scan specific categories only

#### Categories:
- **dependencies**: Python (safety) and NPM (audit) dependency vulnerability scanning
- **secrets**: Pattern-based secret detection in code and git history
- **code**: Static code analysis for Python (bandit) and TypeScript security issues
- **infrastructure**: Azure configuration security validation
- **compliance**: GDPR, data protection, and spiritual content standards

### 2. Compliance Checker (`scripts/compliance-checker.py`)

Advanced Python-based compliance verification system with detailed reporting.

#### Features:
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy policy analysis, consent management verification
- **Data Protection**: Encryption implementation, data retention policy checks
- **Spiritual Content Standards**: Sacred text attribution, expert review systems
- **Technical Security**: TLS/HTTPS configuration, authentication implementation
- **Documentation Compliance**: Required documentation coverage analysis

#### Usage:
```bash
# Full compliance check
python3 scripts/compliance-checker.py --project-root . --verbose

# Generate YAML report
python3 scripts/compliance-checker.py --output compliance.yaml --format yaml

# Check specific category
python3 scripts/compliance-checker.py --category "GDPR" --verbose
```
