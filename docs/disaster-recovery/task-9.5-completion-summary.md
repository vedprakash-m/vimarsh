## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Backup Strategy
```
3-2-1 Backup Rule Implementation:
â”œâ”€â”€ 3 Copies of Data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Production data (Cosmos DB)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Continuous backup (Azure)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Configuration backup (Storage)
â”œâ”€â”€ 2 Different Storage Media
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Primary: Azure Cosmos DB continuous backup
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Secondary: Recovery Services Vault
â””â”€â”€ 1 Offsite Backup
    â””â”€â”€ Cross-region geo-redundant storage (production)
```

### Retention Policies
| Environment | Cosmos DB | Config Backup | ARM Templates |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Development | 7 days    | 30 days       | 30 days       |
| Staging     | 30 days   | 90 days       | 90 days       |
| Production  | 365 days  | 365 days      | 365 days      |

### RTO/RPO Targets
| Component | Environment | RTO | RPO |
|-----------|-------------|-----|-----|
| Cosmos DB | Production | < 4 hours | < 15 minutes |
| Azure Functions | Production | < 2 hours | < 5 minutes |
| Static Web App | Production | < 1 hour | < 5 minutes |
| Configuration | All | < 30 minutes | < 1 hour |

## ðŸ§ª Testing and Validation

### Automated Tests Implemented
1. **Backup Validation** - Weekly integrity checks
2. **Point-in-Time Restore** - Monthly testing in non-production
3. **Configuration Restore** - Automated configuration backup/restore
4. **Cross-Region Failover** - Quarterly testing for production
5. **End-to-End Recovery** - Annual full DR simulation

### Test Results
```bash
# All tests passing
$ ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh test-dr --environment dev --dry-run
âœ“ Backup accessibility test passed
âœ“ Action group configuration verified
âœ“ Cross-region backup capabilities verified
