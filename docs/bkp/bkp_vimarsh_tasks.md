**Note:** We will first do beta testing, during which we need to control on cost. There are 2 key decisions I want you to make sure is reflected consistently and accurately through the project including all the docs and code base:
1. In order to keep the cost, we will have single slot, single environment, single region, cost effective deployment.
2. All the resources needed for the project are divided into 2 resource groups: (a) vimarsh-db-rg: this resource group will have all the persistent resources such as database, key vault and storage account. (b) vimarsh-rg: this resource group will have all the remaining resources, which should mostly be computing resources. The reason for this resource organization is to save on cost. If the app is not needed for extended period of time, I can delete vimarsh-rg to save on operating cost while not losing any context or data. Whenever the app is needed again, I can just have those resources created again under vimarsh-rg to resume operation. This is pause-resume operation solution is my innovation. Also make sure the resources are named minimal with static names so the infrastructure provisioning is idempotent. I don’t want duplicate resources to be created with ci cd executions. The naming convention should be vimarsh-<resource>, like db resource is named vigor-db, key vault is named as vigor-kv, so and so forth.

## Critical Gaps Analysis & Recommendations

**IMPORTANT:** The following critical gaps were identified through comprehensive review against PRD_Vimarsh.md, Tech_Spec_Vimarsh.md, and User_Experience.md:

### **Immediate Action Required:**
1. **Expert Review System** - Core safety requirement (addressed in Task 9.0)
2. **Legal Verification** - Public domain validation (addressed in Task 9.0) 
3. **PWA Features** - Specified as core UX requirement (addressed in Tasks 4.11-4.13)
4. **Analytics Implementation** - Required for user insights and optimization (addressed in Tasks 4.14-4.15)
5. **Cost Monitoring** - Business-critical for sustainability (addressed in Task 7.6)

### **Implementation Order Adjustments:**
- **CODE-FIRST APPROACH:** Start with backend development (Task 1.0), then frontend (Task 4.0)
- **Legal verification** moved to final phase (Task 9.0) as it can happen in parallel with development
- **Expert panel recruitment** positioned as final task since it requires domain expertise
- **PWA features** integrated into core frontend development, not future phase
- **Analytics** built-in from the start for immediate user insights

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Task Execution Protocol
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do NOT start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:** When you finish a sub-task, mark it as completed `[x]` and check if all subtasks under a parent are complete to mark the parent task `[x]`
- **Wait for approval:** Stop after each sub-task and wait for user go-ahead before proceeding

### Quality Standards
- All code must include comprehensive error handling
- Spiritual content must maintain reverence and authenticity
- All components must be tested with both unit and integration tests
- Voice interfaces must handle Sanskrit pronunciation correctly
- UI must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- All API responses must include proper citations from source texts

### Cultural Sensitivity Requirements
- Lord Krishna persona must maintain divine dignity in all responses
- Sanskrit terms must be pronounced correctly in voice output
- Visual design must honor Indian spiritual aesthetics
- All content must be validated by spiritual experts before deployment
- Error messages must be respectful and appropriate for spiritual context

### Technical Requirements
- Backend: Python with Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, Gemini Pro API
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, MSAL.js authentication, Web Speech API
- Infrastructure: Azure Bicep templates, consumption plan for cost optimization
- Testing: pytest for backend, Jest/React Testing Library for frontend
- Voice: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech for quality Hindi support
- Monitoring: Azure Application Insights with custom spiritual guidance metrics
