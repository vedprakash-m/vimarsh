## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Migration Fails
```bash
# Check Cosmos DB connection
python -c "from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient; print('‚úÖ Cosmos SDK OK')"

# Verify environment variables
python -c "import os; print(f'Endpoint: {bool(os.getenv(\"COSMOS_ENDPOINT\"))}')"

# Test vector service initialization
python backend/scripts/vector_admin.py health
```

#### Search Returns No Results
```bash
# Check if data was migrated
python backend/scripts/vector_admin.py stats --personality krishna

# Test embedding generation
python -c "from backend.services.gemini_embedding_service import get_gemini_embedding_service; print('‚úÖ Gemini Embeddings OK')"

# Verify similarity threshold
# Lower SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD in config if needed
```

#### RAG Integration Issues
```bash
# Test LLM service connection
python -c "import google.generativeai as genai; print('‚úÖ Gemini API OK')"

# Check RAG service initialization
python backend/scripts/vector_admin.py search "test query" --personality krishna
```
