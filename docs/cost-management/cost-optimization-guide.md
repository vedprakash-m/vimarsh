## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Cost Management Infrastructure

```bash
# Deploy cost management for development environment
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh deploy -e dev -b 50

# Deploy for production with higher budget
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh deploy -e prod -b 200 -s your-subscription-id
```

### 2. Monitor Current Costs

```bash
# Basic cost monitoring
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh monitor

# Detailed monitoring with specific subscription
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh monitor -s sub-12345 -g vimarsh-rg -v

# Dry-run to preview actions
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh monitor --dry-run
```

### 3. Run Cost Optimization

```bash
# Generate optimization recommendations
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh optimize

# Auto-execute optimizations (with caution)
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh optimize --auto-optimize

# Optimize with verbose output
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh optimize -v
```

### 4. Set Up Budget Alerts

```bash
# Configure budget alerts for current environment
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh alert-setup

# Configure with specific budget amount
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh alert-setup -b 100
```

## Cost Management Features

### Budget Monitoring

#### Alert Thresholds
- **50%**: Mindful monitoring begins - informational alerts
- **80%**: Optimization recommended - warning alerts  
- **90%**: Immediate action required - critical alerts
- **100%**: Emergency controls activated - emergency alerts

#### Budget Configuration by Environment

| Environment | Monthly Budget | Daily Limit | Auto-Optimization |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Development | $50            | $2.50       | Enabled           |
| Staging     | $100           | $5.00       | Enabled           |
| Production  | $200           | $10.00      | Manual Only       |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

# Generate daily report
python3 backend/cost_management/vimarsh_cost_monitor.py \
  -e prod -b 200 -o reports/daily_cost_$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### 2. Weekly Optimization Review

```bash
# Comprehensive optimization analysis

# Clean up unused resources
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh cleanup --dry-run
```

### 3. Monthly Budget Planning

```bash
# Deploy new budget for next month
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh deploy -e prod -b 250

# Generate monthly cost dashboard
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh dashboard
```

### 4. Emergency Cost Control

```bash
# Emergency resource cleanup
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh cleanup --auto-optimize

# Emergency throttling (manual intervention)
# Implement through Azure portal or API calls
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

- `admin@vimarsh.ai`
- `devops@vimarsh.ai`

### Alert Channels

1. **Email**: Immediate notifications for all thresholds
2. **Azure Action Groups**: Integration with Azure monitoring
3. **Webhook**: Custom API endpoints for automation
4. **Dashboard**: Real-time cost visualization

### Custom Metrics

The system tracks:
- Cost per spiritual guidance query
- Cost per active user
- Infrastructure utilization efficiency
- Optimization success rates

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### High-Impact Optimizations

1. **Right-size Cosmos DB**: Potential savings 25-40%
2. **Optimize Function Plans**: Potential savings 20-30%
3. **Implement Scheduling**: Potential savings 15-25%
4. **Asset Optimization**: Potential savings 5-15%

### Low-Risk Quick Wins

1. **Enable auto-scaling**: Immediate cost adaptation
2. **Implement caching**: Reduce compute costs
3. **Optimize queries**: Lower database costs
4. **Compress assets**: Reduce bandwidth costs

## Integration with Azure Services

### Azure Cost Management API

```python
# Example: Get cost data
from backend.cost_management.vimarsh_cost_monitor import VimarshCostMonitor

monitor = VimarshCostMonitor(
    subscription_id="your-subscription-id",
    budget_amount=Decimal('100'),
    environment='prod'
)

report = await monitor.run_cost_monitoring_cycle()
print(f"Budget utilization: {report['budget_status']['utilization_percentage']:.1f}%")
```

### Application Insights Integration

Custom events tracked:
- `CostAlert`: Budget threshold alerts
- `OptimizationAction`: Automated optimizations
- `BudgetUpdate`: Budget configuration changes
- `ResourceOptimization`: Resource efficiency improvements

## Spiritual Principles in Cost Management

### Dharmic Resource Stewardship

> "Just as Lord Krishna teaches about the importance of righteous action without attachment to results, we must manage our resources mindfully, optimizing costs while maintaining service quality." - Bhagavad Gita inspired wisdom

### Core Principles

1. **Mindful Spending**: Every expense serves the spiritual mission
2. **Balanced Action**: Neither wasteful nor stingy
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular optimization and reflection
4. **Service Orientation**: Cost efficiency enables better spiritual guidance

### Daily Practice

- **Morning**: Check cost utilization with gratitude
- **Midday**: Monitor for anomalies with awareness
- **Evening**: Review optimizations with wisdom

### Decision Framework

When making cost decisions, ask:
1. Does this expense serve our spiritual mission?
2. Can we achieve the same result more efficiently?
3. What would Lord Krishna advise about this resource use?
4. How does this align with dharmic principles?

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Budget Alerts Not Triggering

**Symptoms**: No alerts despite high spending
**Solutions**:
- Verify action group configuration
- Check email addresses in alert settings
- Confirm budget scope and resource group
- Test with manual budget update

#### 2. Optimization Script Failures

**Symptoms**: Script exits with errors
**Solutions**:
- Check Azure CLI authentication: `az account show`
- Verify subscription permissions
- Ensure resource group exists
- Run with `--dry-run` first

#### 3. Cost Data Inconsistencies

**Symptoms**: Reported costs don't match Azure portal
**Solutions**:
- Allow 24-48 hours for cost data updates
- Verify resource scope and time periods
- Check for subscription-level vs resource group costs
- Confirm timezone settings

#### 4. High Cost Anomalies

**Symptoms**: Unexpected cost spikes
**Immediate Actions**:
- Run emergency cost analysis: `./scripts/cost-optimization.sh monitor -v`
- Check for unusual resource scaling
- Review Application Insights for traffic spikes
- Implement emergency throttling if needed

### Emergency Procedures

#### 1. Budget Exceeded

```bash
# Immediate assessment
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh monitor --verbose

# Emergency cleanup (with caution)
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh cleanup --dry-run

# If safe, execute cleanup
./scripts/cost-optimization.sh cleanup
```

#### 2. Resource Runaway

```bash
# Identify expensive resources
python3 backend/cost_management/vimarsh_cost_monitor.py -v

# Scale down or pause non-critical resources through Azure portal
# Update budget alerts for immediate notifications
```

## Best Practices

### Daily Operations

1. **Morning Review**: Check overnight cost accumulation
2. **Resource Planning**: Plan resource changes with cost impact
3. **Alert Monitoring**: Respond to budget alerts promptly
4. **Optimization**: Implement at least one optimization weekly

### Weekly Operations

1. **Cost Trend Analysis**: Review weekly spending patterns
