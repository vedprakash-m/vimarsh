# Vimarsh Project Metadata

## Project Overview

**Vimarsh** is an AI-powered spiritual guidance system that provides personalized spiritual advice based on Hindu sacred texts, implemented as Lord Krishna's divine persona. The system leverages RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture to deliver contextually relevant spiritual guidance with proper citations from authentic sources.

## Deployment Architecture & Cost Strategy

### Single Environment Production Deployment
- **Environment Strategy**: Single production environment for cost efficiency (no dev/staging environments)
- **Region Strategy**: Single region deployment (East US) to minimize cross-region costs
- **Slot Strategy**: Single deployment slot to avoid multiple environment overhead

### Innovative Pause-Resume Cost Strategy
Vimarsh implements an innovative **two-resource-group architecture** designed for maximum cost efficiency:

#### Resource Group 1: vimarsh-db-rg (Persistent Resources)
- **Purpose**: Data retention and persistence through deployment cycles
- **Resources**: Cosmos DB (vimarsh-db), Key Vault (vimarsh-kv), Storage Account (vimarshstorage)
- **Cost Behavior**: Always active, minimal storage costs
- **Strategy**: These resources preserve all user data, configurations, and spiritual content

#### Resource Group 2: vimarsh-rg (Compute Resources)  
- **Purpose**: Application execution and user interaction
- **Resources**: Function App (vimarsh-functions), Static Web App (vimarsh-web), App Insights (vimarsh-insights)
- **Cost Behavior**: Can be completely deleted during inactive periods
- **Strategy**: Full pause-resume capability without data loss

#### Pause-Resume Operations
1. **Pause (Cost Savings)**: Delete entire vimarsh-rg resource group
   - Eliminates all compute costs (Functions, hosting, monitoring)
   - Retains all data, configurations, and user content in vimarsh-db-rg
   - Reduces monthly costs to minimal storage fees (~$5-10/month)

2. **Resume (Restore Service)**: Redeploy compute infrastructure
   - Recreate vimarsh-rg with identical resource names
   - Automatically reconnects to existing data in vimarsh-db-rg  
   - Full service restoration within minutes
   - No data migration or configuration required

### Idempotent Resource Naming
All resources use **static, minimal names** to ensure deployment consistency:
- Database: `vimarsh-db` (never vimarsh-db-20241226 or similar)
- Key Vault: `vimarsh-kv`
- Functions: `vimarsh-functions`
- Storage: `vimarshstorage`
- Web App: `vimarsh-web`

This prevents duplicate resource creation during CI/CD cycles and ensures reliable pause-resume operations.
