**Vimarsh** is an AI-powered spiritual guidance system that provides personalized spiritual advice based on Hindu sacred texts, implemented as Lord Krishna's divine persona. The system leverages RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture to deliver contextually relevant spiritual guidance with proper citations from authentic sources.

## Technology Stack

### Backend (Azure Functions - Python 3.12)
- **API Framework**: Azure Functions with HTTP triggers
- **AI/LLM**: Google Gemini Pro API integration
- **Vector Database**: Azure Cosmos DB with vector search capabilities
- **Authentication**: Microsoft Entra External ID
- **Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault for secrets management

### Frontend (React 18 + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with modern tooling
- **Voice Interface**: Web Speech API for input/output
- **PWA**: Service Worker with offline caching
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Styling**: Sacred Harmony design system with cultural aesthetics

### Infrastructure (Azure Cloud)
- **IaC**: Bicep templates with two-resource-group architecture
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows with idempotent deployments
- **Deployment**: Single production environment with pause-resume cost strategy
- **Cost Management**: Innovative resource group separation for maximum cost efficiency

## Deployment Architecture & Cost Strategy

### Innovative Two-Resource-Group Architecture
Vimarsh implements a groundbreaking architecture designed for maximum cost efficiency:

#### Resource Group 1: vimarsh-db-rg (Persistent Resources)
- **Purpose**: Data retention and persistence through deployment cycles
- **Resources**: Cosmos DB (vimarsh-db), Key Vault (vimarsh-kv), Storage Account (vimarshstorage)
- **Cost Behavior**: Always active, minimal storage costs (~$5-10/month)
- **Strategy**: Preserves all user data, configurations, and spiritual content

#### Resource Group 2: vimarsh-rg (Compute Resources)
- **Purpose**: Application execution and user interaction
- **Resources**: Function App (vimarsh-functions), Static Web App (vimarsh-web), App Insights (vimarsh-insights)
- **Cost Behavior**: Can be completely deleted during inactive periods
- **Strategy**: Full pause-resume capability without data loss

#### Pause-Resume Operations
1. **Pause (Cost Savings)**: Delete entire vimarsh-rg resource group
   - Eliminates all compute costs (Functions, hosting, monitoring)
   - Retains all data in vimarsh-db-rg
   - Reduces monthly costs to ~$5-10/month

2. **Resume (Restore Service)**: Redeploy compute infrastructure
   - Recreate vimarsh-rg with identical resource names
   - Automatically reconnects to existing data
   - Full service restoration within minutes

### Single Environment Production Strategy
- **Environment Strategy**: Single production environment for cost efficiency
- **Region Strategy**: Single region deployment (East US) for minimal cross-region costs
- **Slot Strategy**: Single deployment slot to avoid multiple environment overhead
