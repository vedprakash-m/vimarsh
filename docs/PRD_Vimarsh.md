## 1. Executive Summary

**Vimarsh** is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to provide accessible, context-rich insights and guidance drawn from foundational Indian spiritual texts. Leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, it enables users to explore philosophical concepts, ethical dilemmas, and life lessons through the **profound and divine perspective of Lord Krishna**. By grounding responses strictly in texts like the Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharata, and Srimad Bhagavatam, Vimarsh aims to democratize access to timeless wisdom. Users can interact with the agent through text or voice, and receive responses in multiple languages including Hindi, with more languages to be added later. The core principle is to ensure the **highest possible standard for divine, respectful, and textually faithful responses**, doing full justice to the opportunity to engage with Lord Krishna's wisdom. We plan to extend the wisdom by adding more texts and revered personalities for conversation in future iterations.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals today seek guidance for complex life decisions, ethical understanding, and deeper meaning. While the rich traditions of Indian spiritual texts offer profound wisdom, they are often:

* **Inaccessible:** Voluminous, written in archaic language, and require deep scholarly effort to comprehend.
* **Fragmented & Disjointed:** Insights related to a specific figure (like Lord Krishna) are scattered across multiple, lengthy texts, making comprehensive understanding challenging.
* **Overwhelming:** Users are unsure where to begin or how to extract relevant wisdom for specific modern dilemmas from thousands of verses.
* **Lacking Personalization:** Generic interpretations don't resonate with individual questions or specific life situations.
* **Language Barrier:** The wisdom is primarily available in English translations, limiting access for non-English speakers.
* **Engagement Barrier:** Text-only interfaces can sometimes lack the immediacy and naturalness of human conversation.

This results in a missed opportunity for personal growth, ethical clarity, and cultural connection, leading to reliance on less grounded advice or disengagement from a rich spiritual heritage.
