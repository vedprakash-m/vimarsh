      "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no duty. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no duty. PurportIn this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfoldyogasystem is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age of Kali. Although the eightfoldyogasystem is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process ofkarma-yoga,or acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfectsannyāsī,the perfectyogī.Thesannyāsīssometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to performagnihotra yajñas(fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to become one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mysticyogīwho practices theyogasystem with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, and thus he is the perfectsannyāsī,or perfectyogī.Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁkavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmayemama janmani janmanīśvarebhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi“O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is the causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth.”",

Kṛṣṇa consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially Kṛṣṇa conscious, because the impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of Kṛṣṇa and the Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of Kṛṣṇa. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly Kṛṣṇa conscious.

His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditativeyogīare imperfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious.Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on Kṛṣṇa. One should always think of Kṛṣṇa and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is calledsamādhi,or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī characterizes Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this way:anāsaktasya viṣayān, yathārham upayuñjataḥnirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe, yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyateprāpañcikatayā buddhyāhari-sambandhi-vastunaḥmumukṣubhiḥ parityāgovairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate“When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to Kṛṣṇa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.

Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact. PurportBy practice ofyogaone becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of theyogaprinciple. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, orsamādhi,which means that theyogīrealizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself.Yogapractice is more or less based on the principles of the Patañjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Patañjali system ofyoga.There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patañjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure – realized through transcendental senses – is accepted. And this is corroborated by Patañjali Muni, the famous exponent of theyogasystem. The great sage declares in hisYoga-sūtras(4.33):puruṣārtha-śūnyānāṁ guṇānāṁ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.Thisciti-śakti,or internal potency, is transcendental.Puruṣārthameans material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This “oneness with the Supreme” is calledkaivalyamby the monist. But according to Patañjali, thiskaivalyamis an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is calledceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam,or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This “clearance” is actually liberation, orbhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.The theory ofnirvāṇa– also preliminary – corresponds with this principle. In theBhāgavatam(2.10.6)this is calledsvarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ.TheBhagavad-gītāalso confirms this situation in this verse.Afternirvāṇa,or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service to the Lord, known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the words of theBhāgavatam, svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ:this is the “real life of the living entity.”Māyā,or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Patañjali also accepts this by his wordskaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.Thisciti-śakti,or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in theVedānta-sūtra(1.1.12) asānanda-mayo ’bhyāsāt.This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal ofyogaand is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, orbhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yogawill be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter ofBhagavad-gītā.In theyogasystem, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds ofsamādhi,calledsamprajñāta-samādhiandasamprajñāta-samādhi.When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, he is said to have achievedsamprajñāta-samādhi.In theasamprajñāta-samādhithere is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When theyogīis once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless theyogīis able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today’s so-calledyogapractice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. Ayogīindulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even thoseyogīswho are attracted by thesiddhis(perfections) in the process ofyogaare not perfectly situated. Ifyogīsare attracted by the by-products ofyoga,then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats orsiddhisshould know that the aim ofyogais lost in that way.The best practice ofyogain this age is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is not baffling. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicinghaṭha-yoga, dhyāna-yogaandjñāna-yoga,but there is no such problem in executingkarma-yogaorbhakti-yoga.As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating.

One who is Kṛṣṇa conscious is a perfectyogī;he is aware of everyone’s happiness and distress by dint of his own personal experience. The cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And the cause of happiness is knowing Kṛṣṇa to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being, the proprietor of all lands and planets, and the sincerest friend of all living entities. The perfectyogīknows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. And because one in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of Kṛṣṇa everywhere. Since the perfectyogītries to broadcast the importance of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord.Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ(Bg. 18.69). In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is the bestyogībecause he does not desire perfection inyogafor his personal benefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and ayogīinterested only in his personal elevation. Theyogīwho has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

PurportThe difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is accepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present age no one can observe the strict rules and regulations of placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about Kṛṣṇa. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about Kṛṣṇa, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from Kṛṣṇa. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learnvairāgya. Vairāgyameans detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of Kṛṣṇa. This is practical because by hearing about Kṛṣṇa one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is calledpareśānubhava,spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction and strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.",

The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about Kṛṣṇa. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about Kṛṣṇa, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from Kṛṣṇa. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learnvairāgya. Vairāgyameans detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of Kṛṣṇa. This is practical because by hearing about Kṛṣṇa one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is calledpareśānubhava,spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction and strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

PurportThe path of self-realization or mysticism is described in theBhagavad-gītā.The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice of the eightfold system or bybhakti-yoga.In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Son of Pṛthā, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil. PurportIn theŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam(1.5.17)Śrī Nārada Muni instructs Vyāsadeva as follows:tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harerbhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadiyatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁko vārtha āpto ’bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ“If someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way. On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything.” For material prospects there are many activities, both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One may argue that by Kṛṣṇa consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. TheBhāgavatamassures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction for not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious Kṛṣṇa consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.The purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, certainly progress in life.Those who are following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate liberation from material existence, and (3) those who are devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life – even to the higher planets – but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity. And because the eightfoldyogasystem is directed toward the ultimate realization of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.",

The English word “worship” cannot be used in the same sense asbhaj.Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. TheBhāgavatam(11.5.3)confirms this as follows:ya eṣāṁ puruṣaṁ sākṣādātma-prabhavam īśvaramna bhajanty avajānantisthānād bhraṣṭāḥ patanty adhaḥ“Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position.”In this verse also the wordbhajantiis used. Therefore,bhajantiis applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word “worship” can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The wordavajānanti,used in this verse ofŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam,is also found in theBhagavad-gītā. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ:“Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa.” Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on theBhagavad-gītāwithout an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the wordbhajantiand the word “worship.”The culmination of all kinds ofyogapractices lies inbhakti yoga.All otheryogasare but means to come to the point ofbhaktiinbhakti-yoga. Yogaactually meansbhakti-yoga;all otheryogasare progressions toward the destination ofbhakti-yoga.From the beginning ofkarma-yogato the end ofbhakti-yogais a long way to self-realization.Karma-yoga,without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. Whenkarma-yogaincreases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is calledjñāna-yoga.Whenjñāna-yogaincreases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is calledaṣṭāṅga-yoga.And when one surpasses theaṣṭāṅga-yogaand comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, it is calledbhakti-yoga,the culmination. Factually,bhakti-yogais the ultimate goal, but to analyzebhakti-yogaminutely one has to understand these otheryogas.Theyogīwho is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name:karma-yogī, jñāna-yogīordhyāna-yogī, rāja-yogī, haṭha-yogī,etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point ofbhakti-yoga,it is to be understood that he has surpassed all otheryogas.Therefore, to become Kṛṣṇa conscious is the highest stage ofyoga,just as, when we speak of Himālayan, we refer to the world’s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.It is by great fortune that one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness on the path ofbhakti-yogato become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The idealyogīconcentrates his attention on Kṛṣṇa, who is called Śyāmasundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and whose body is flower-garlanded.

He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highestyogī.This stage of highest perfection inyogacan be attained only bybhakti-yoga,as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:yasya deve parā bhaktiryathā deve tathā gurautasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥprakāśante mahātmanaḥ“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.” (Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad6.23)Bhaktir asya bhajanaṁ tad ihāmutropādhi-nairāsyenāmuṣmin manaḥ-kalpanam, etad eva naiṣkarmyam.“Bhaktimeans devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the purpose ofnaiṣkarmya.” (Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad1.15)These are some of the means for performance ofbhakti,or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of theyogasystem.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of theŚrīmad Bhagavad-gītāin the matter ofDhyāna-yoga.",
