    "threshold": "$10.00",
    "message": "üôè Divine guidance reminds us of mindful resource usage"
  },
  "daily_budget_critical": {
    "threshold": "$15.00", 
    "message": "‚ö†Ô∏è The path of wisdom includes conscious spending"
  },
  "daily_budget_emergency": {
    "threshold": "$20.00",
    "message": "üõë Emergency protocols activated - seeking balance"
  }
}
```

#### Usage Example
```python
from backend.cost_management.real_time_monitor import get_monitor, track_cost

# Automatic cost tracking
@track_cost(user_id="user123", model="gemini-pro", operation="spiritual_chat")
async def spiritual_guidance_function():
    return await process_spiritual_query()

# Manual monitoring
monitor = get_monitor()
await monitor.start_monitoring(interval_seconds=30)
```
